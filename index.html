      <h2>Hi! I'm Sarah, Rice University c/o '26</h2>
      <p>I make comprehensive illustrations for professional scientific purposes. 
        I work by comission and can draw anything from molecular biology to gross anatomy. 
        <br>
        I study for my classes by making art, and I'd like to share my art with the broader scientific community here at Rice and beyond. 
        If you need a diagram for a class you teach, a graphic for a laboratory publication, or any other biology or biocehmistry-related illustration, that's my skillset.
        I research every project I do thoroughly to make sure I understand the science. 
        After all, I'm the first person to learn from my illustrations. It should also be noted that I'm open to expanding subjects. I love science and 
  I'm always willing to learn more about geology, physics, chemistry, or whatever else may cross my path.</p>
